# This test file was removed because the runner no longer supports --use-external-scripts.
# The runner now always uses the repository-local canonical downloader, so the behavior
# tested previously is no longer relevant. If this behavior needs to be restored in the
# future, add a test that verifies the opt-in flag's behavior.
